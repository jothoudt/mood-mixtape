## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mood-mixtape.git
cd mood-mixtape
```

## 1. Install dependencies
yarn install

## 2. Create a Spotify App
Go to Spotify Developer Dashboard
Create a new app
Set your Redirect URI to:
```
https://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify
```
(Spotify does not allow localhost)

## 3. Environment Variables
Create .env.local in /client

```
# Spotify credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=super-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Spotify embed playback may be restricted by browser **third-party cookie** settings.  
  - If playback doesn‚Äôt start inside the embed, try **allowing third-party cookies for `open.spotify.com`** in your browser settings.  
  - Alternatively, click ‚ÄúOpen in Spotify‚Äù to launch the playlist in a new tab.
- Redirect URIs **must** match exactly between your `.env.local` and Spotify dashboard.
- For local development, HTTP works fine (`http://127.0.0.1:3000`) ‚Äî HTTPS is only required for production.
