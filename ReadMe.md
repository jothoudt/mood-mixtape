## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1 Clone the repo && install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mood-mixtape.git
cd mood-mixtape
yarn install
```

## 2. Create a Spotify App
Go to Spotify Developer Dashboard
Create a new app
Set your Redirect URI to:
```
https://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify
```
(Spotify does not allow localhost)

## 3. Environment Variables
Create .env.local in /client

```
# Spotify credentials
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=super-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
```
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

api/env:
# OpenAI key (used by the Express API)
OPEN_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional (default is https://api.spotify.com/v1)
SPOTIFY_API_BASE_URL=https://api.spotify.com/v1

# CORS (must match the client origin you actually use)
CORS_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:3000

PORT=4000

App will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:3000

## Usage Tips
- When you click "Create on Spotify" while logged out, the app:
 1. Saves { mood, genre, songs } to localStorage
 2. Redirects to Spotify consent via Next Auth
 3. Returns to the same page and restores your list

## Scripts
- From the repo root:

- yarn dev - run Next + API in parallel via Turborepo
- yarn build - build all packages
- yarn start - run built apps (Express on 4000, Next on 3000)
- yarn lint/yarn typecheck - quality checks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Spotify embed playback may be restricted by browser **third-party cookie** settings.  
  - If playback doesn‚Äôt start inside the embed, try **allowing third-party cookies for `open.spotify.com`** in your browser settings.  
  - Alternatively, click ‚ÄúOpen in Spotify‚Äù to launch the playlist in a new tab.
- Redirect URIs **must** match exactly between your `.env.local` and Spotify dashboard.
- For local development, HTTP works fine (`http://127.0.0.1:3000`) ‚Äî HTTPS is only required for production.
